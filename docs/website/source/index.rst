Pazzk Developer Documentation
=============================

Pazzk is built on certificate-based communication, real-time control, and
a maintainable firmware architecture. This documentation transparently outlines
the technical foundations, enabling anyone to verify and extend the system

합니다. 이 문서는 그 기술적 기반을 투명하게 공개하고, 누구나 검증하고 확장할
수 있도록 돕습니다.
